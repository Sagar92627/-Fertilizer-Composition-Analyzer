Class Definition: The FertilizerAnalyzer class encapsulates the properties and methods related to fertilizer analysis.
Initialization: The constructor takes percentages of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium as inputs.
Methods:
verify_composition(): Displays the nutrient composition.
quality_control(): Checks that nutrient percentages are non-negative.
crop_performance(): Evaluates the total nutrient content and warns if it exceeds 100%.
compliance_assurance(): Placeholder for compliance checks.
cost_efficiency(): Calculates and displays average nutrient usage efficiency.
This code can be used to analyze fertilizer compositions and ensure quality control in a laboratory setting.
